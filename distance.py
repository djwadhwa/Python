    Take a vector of x-locations and a vector of y-locations and calculate
    the distance at all points defined by those locations from a given point

    Method Arguments:
    * x-vector:  A vector of x locations where values are integers.
    * y-vector:  A vector of y locations where values are integers.
    * point:  A 2D point that distances are calculated from
    
    Output:
    * dist is a 2D array that contains float values of distance between the 
    location and the given point

    distance can be calculated by using the distance formula:
        d = âˆš(((y1-y0)^2)+((x1-x0)^2))
